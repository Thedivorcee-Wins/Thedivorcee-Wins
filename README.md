- 👋 Hi, I’m @Thedivorcee-Wins
- 👀 I’m interested in security and privacy for myself, my Mum and Brother, my friends, and anyone else that comes within WiFi/Bluetooth range of me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to heal from the 18+ month long abuse from an absolutely ignorant "bad actor" that has been terrorizing me and terrifying my friends and family.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any new security measures that I can implement for all people that suffer at the hands of lowlifes.
- 📫 How to reach me: BadlyManaged@Gmail.com is a play on words describing my life.
